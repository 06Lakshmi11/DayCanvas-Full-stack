## About The Project

DayCanvas is a month-view calendar app where you can write notes, build checklists, attach photos, set reminders, and see real public holidays — all on any day you click. It started as a fully client-side app, and now has a real backend so notes sync across devices with proper user accounts.

This repository contains **both halves** of the project:
- `frontend/` — the React app users interact with
- `backend/` — the Node.js/Express API and MongoDB database that stores everything

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React 18, Vite 5
- Plain CSS with custom properties for theming
- Nager.Date API for public holidays

**Backend**
- Node.js, Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- bcryptjs for password hashing

## Getting Started

You'll need **two terminals running at the same time** — one for the backend, one for the frontend.

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/` (copy from `.env.example`) with:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/daycanvas?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your-long-random-secret-string
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:

MongoDB connected
DayCanvas API listening on
 http://localhost:5000

**Keep this terminal running.**

### 2. Frontend Setup

In a **new** terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `frontend/` with:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) — you'll land on a login/signup screen.

## How It All Connects
Browser (React frontend)
      │
      │  fetch() calls with a JWT token
      ▼
Express API (backend/server.js)
      │
      │  Mongoose queries
      ▼
MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)

Every note action (add, edit, delete, checklist toggle) sends a request from the frontend to the backend, which checks your login token, then reads/writes to MongoDB. Nothing is saved in the browser anymore except your login token and a few UI preferences (theme, selected country).

## Good to Know

- **Reminders only fire while the tab is open** — no service worker/push notifications yet.
- **Holiday data** comes from the free Nager.Date API and may not have full coverage for every country.
- **Photos** are resized client-side before upload to keep request sizes reasonable.
- Both `frontend/.env` and `backend/.env` are gitignored — anyone cloning this repo needs to create their own.

## Ideas to Extend

- True background push notifications via a service worker
- Recurring/repeating notes
- `.ics` export for Google/Outlook/Apple Calendar
- A year-at-a-glance view
- Deploy the backend (Render/Railway) and frontend (Vercel/Netlify) so it's live for anyone, not just localhost
